<h3>Goals</h3><p><a href="http://www.jellybean-games.com/">Jellybean Games</a> has a mission statement: to make kid-friendly games that grown-ups will love.</p><p>It also has a goal: to generate enough income that I can live off it full-time.</p><p>At the moment I'm a professional author. Writing has been my sole source of income since 2012, so I could theoretically work on Jellybean Games as a side-project for the rest of my life...but I am a firm believer in having concrete, tangible goals, and that's my goal for Jellybean Games: to start earning enough money to support me full-time by the end of 2018.</p><p>Now, depending on your confidence in my skills, knowledge of the board game industry, and level of optimism, that might seem like an impossible goal or ludicrously simple - I think it lands somewhere between the two.</p><p>On one hand, there are <em>very </em>few board game companies who have even one full-time employee, especially since the board game boom. The vast majority of them are side-projects, with the people who run them holding normal jobs as well.</p><p>On the other hand...well, others have done it. Why not me?</p><p>This blog is (for the foreseeable future) going to be dedicated to exploring that question.</p><h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3><p>So, who am I to think that I can stroll in and just start making money from game design?</p><p>Hi! My name's Peter. I'm a 28-year old Australian, trying to move to America. I've been writing and working on creative projects for literally as long as I can remember. In the past ten years I've:</p><ul><li>Self-funded and filmed 4 television pilots.</li><li>Crowd-funded and filmed a 5th television pilot.</li><li>Run a video-editing business.</li><li>Been featured on <a href="http://Cracked.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cracked.com</a></li><li>Written more than a million words over various blogs.</li><li>Written more than a million words of creative fiction.</li><li>Produced and starred in dozens of live comedy shows.</li></ul><p>That's a bit of an eclectic CV, so I thought I'd break it down into strength and weaknesses.</p><h4>Strengths</h4><ul><li><strong>Talent.</strong>I wouldn't have done any of the above if I didn't think I was good at them, and honestly, I think one of the things I'm best at is game design.</li><li><strong>I learn fast.</strong>In the past few months I've done as much reading as I can about running a business: branding, value creation, generating buzz...basically everything I can about how to go from "not having a business" to "having a successful business". And that doesn't even cover my obsessive Kickstarter research over the past year and a half.</li><li><strong>Connections.</strong>I'm close with the guys who run<a href="http://www.greaterthangames.com/">Greater Than Games</a>, and they've been helpfully offering me advice on all aspects of running a board game business. On top of that, I know a lot of people (especially gamers) from a lot of different places. I have access to a bunch of specific skills, tips, help, and potential organic promotion when I make cool things.</li><li><strong>Time.</strong>My day-job lets me set my own hours. If I want to, I can spend 2 weeks straight doing nothing but developing a board game (or, say, running a Kickstarter).</li><li><strong>Money.</strong>I'm not rich by any measure, but I have enough disposable income that I can pre-fund some of the more expensive elements of Kickstarting a game. Art, graphic design, advertising, getting review copies out.</li><li><strong>I'm mobile.</strong>As well as my day-job not setting my hours, it also doesn't have particular location requirements. If I decide that going to every con in the world is vital to running Jellybean Games, I have the ability to do exactly that; I have no boss to answer to.</li><li><strong>I'm skilled.</strong>This is a broad one, but all the projects I've worked on have given me an interesting mix of skills...and, just as importantly, recognition of the skills I'm lacking. I can design a board game, put together copy, assemble an amazing team and ensure everyone stays on-schedule, write, film and edit a Kickstarter video, etc etc...but you'll never see me doing the art for one of my games. I know people far more talented than I to take care of that.</li><li><strong>I get stuff done.</strong>If you're a fan of the dreamer/doer dichotomy, I'm firmly in the "both" category. I have pretty big dreams and then do everything I can towards making them happen. Add to this the fact that I work fast: I can get a<strong>lot</strong>done in a month.</li></ul><h4>Weaknesses</h4><ul><li><strong>I work too hard, I'm a perfectionist, and I'm too good looking.</strong>I swear; it's a curse.</li><li><strong>Sometimes I'll end<a href="http://www.beard.blue/the-blue-beard-business-story-part-2">blog posts</a>with weird jokes about everyone I know dying</strong>...and then totally fail to follow up.</li></ul><p>More seriously though:</p><ul><li><strong>I'm good at abandoning things.</strong>This might seem like a good thing, but it isn't always. I've lived in (and left) 5 major cities, and I'll have done the same with at least two more before another decade has passed. If something (or someone) starts to bore me, I find it very easy to just throw in the towel and move on. This is unlikely to happen with Jellybean Games - I've put a lot of time and money into it so far (logo, website, art for games) - or Blue Beard Entertainment generally. But it's certainly a possibility.</li><li><strong>I'm not great at deadlines.</strong>I'm pretty good at<em>keeping</em>deadlines - my issue is with<em>setting</em>deadlines. Part of this (especially for Jellybean Games) is that I simply don't know how long things take. Part of it is that I'm going to be working with a bunch of people I don't normally work with and sometimes my estimates for how long it'll take them to do things is way off. And part of it is that I, uh, forget to make a timeline and so things just sort of drift along until they suddenly become urgent (although I'm getting better at avoiding that).</li><li><strong>Sometimes I'll get caught up in other creative commitments and disappear.</strong>Again, this is something I've really been working on lately, but if my authorial income abruptly disappeared, I'd have to put everything else on the side while I worked on that. Sometimes I'll have some little idea that I get obsessed with (like<a href="http://www.beinghonestwithmyex.com/">starting a podcast with my ex</a>) and suddenly that's all I'm working on for a week.</li><li><strong>I don't have a home.</strong>This is arguably a strength, but moving around a lot (in the first 3 months of 2016 I'm going to be in 8+ different countries, and none of them are going to be where I live for the next few years) can take up time and energy. On the plus side, I have no pesky "friends" or "family" to distract me while I'm on the road!</li><li><strong>I'm new to this.</strong>Everyone is new at some point, so I'm not beating myself up about it, but the fact is: I don't have a relationship with a printer, or a presence on Kickstarter, or any particular credentials or accolades behind me. I learn fast, and I am getting better at learning from other people's mistakes instead of repeating them myself, but there's a<em>lot</em>to learn. Still, no better way to learn than to jump in head-first!</li></ul><p>To my mind, those strengths greatly outweigh the weaknesses. Add to that the pattern in my life of things going my way (you can call it luck, hard work, or just being a straight white male) and, all things considered, I think Jellybean Games has a pretty great chance of success. (And if it doesn't manage to achieve its goals, I'll learn a bunch for the next project!)</p><p>*Up next:<a href="http://www.beard.blue/the-blue-beard-business-story-part-4">Part 4 -*<strong><em>Goals, Strengths and Weaknesses</em></strong></a></p><picture>

I can design a board game, put together copy, assemble an amazing team and ensure everyone stays on-schedule, write, film and edit a Kickstarter video, etc etc...but you'll never see me doing the art for one of my games.

I've lived in (and left) 5 major cities, and I'll have done the same with at least two more before another decade has passed. If something (or someone) starts to bore me, I find it very easy to just throw in the towel and move on.

Part of this (especially for Jellybean Games) is that I simply don't know how long things take. Part of it is that I'm going to be working with a bunch of people I don't normally work with and sometimes my estimates for how long it'll take them to do things is way off.
