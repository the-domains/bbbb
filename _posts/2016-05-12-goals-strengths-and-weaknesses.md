## Goals, Strengths and Weaknesses

### Goals  

[Jellybean Games][0] has a mission statement: to make kid-friendly games that grown-ups will love.

It also has a goal: to generate enough income that I can live off it full-time.

At the moment I'm a professional author. Writing has been my sole source of income since 2012, so I could theoretically work on Jellybean Games as a side-project for the rest of my life...but I am a firm believer in having concrete, tangible goals, and that's my goal for Jellybean Games: to start earning enough money to support me full-time by the end of 2018\.

Now, depending on your confidence in my skills, knowledge of the board game industry, and level of optimism, that might seem like an impossible goal or ludicrously simple - I think it lands somewhere between the two.

On one hand, there are _very _few board game companies who have even one full-time employee, especially since the board game boom. The vast majority of them are side-projects, with the people who run them holding normal jobs as well.

On the other hand...well, others have done it. Why not me?

This blog is (for the foreseeable future) going to be dedicated to exploring that question.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

So, who am I to think that I can stroll in and just start making money from game design?

Hi! My name's Peter. I'm a 28-year old Australian, trying to move to America. I've been writing and working on creative projects for literally as long as I can remember. In the past ten years I've:

* Self-funded and filmed 4 television pilots.
* Crowd-funded and filmed a 5th television pilot.
* Run a video-editing business.
* Been featured on Cracked.com
* Written more than a million words over various blogs.
* Written more than a million words of creative fiction.
* Produced and starred in dozens of live comedy shows.

That's a bit of an eclectic CV, so I thought I'd break it down into strength and weaknesses.

#### Strengths

* **Talent.**I wouldn't have done any of the above if I didn't think I was good at them, and honestly, I think one of the things I'm best at is game design.
* **I learn fast.**In the past few months I've done as much reading as I can about running a business: branding, value creation, generating buzz...basically everything I can about how to go from "not having a business" to "having a successful business". And that doesn't even cover my obsessive Kickstarter research over the past year and a half.
* **Connections.**I'm close with the guys who run[Greater Than Games][1], and they've been helpfully offering me advice on all aspects of running a board game business. On top of that, I know a lot of people (especially gamers) from a lot of different places. I have access to a bunch of specific skills, tips, help, and potential organic promotion when I make cool things.
* **Time.**My day-job lets me set my own hours. If I want to, I can spend 2 weeks straight doing nothing but developing a board game (or, say, running a Kickstarter).
* **Money.**I'm not rich by any measure, but I have enough disposable income that I can pre-fund some of the more expensive elements of Kickstarting a game. Art, graphic design, advertising, getting review copies out.
* **I'm mobile.**As well as my day-job not setting my hours, it also doesn't have particular location requirements. If I decide that going to every con in the world is vital to running Jellybean Games, I have the ability to do exactly that; I have no boss to answer to.
* **I'm skilled.**This is a broad one, but all the projects I've worked on have given me an interesting mix of skills...and, just as importantly, recognition of the skills I'm lacking. I can design a board game, put together copy, assemble an amazing team and ensure everyone stays on-schedule, write, film and edit a Kickstarter video, etc etc...but you'll never see me doing the art for one of my games. I know people far more talented than I to take care of that.
* **I get stuff done.**If you're a fan of the dreamer/doer dichotomy, I'm firmly in the "both" category. I have pretty big dreams and then do everything I can towards making them happen. Add to this the fact that I work fast: I can get a**lot**done in a month.

#### Weaknesses

* **I work too hard, I'm a perfectionist, and I'm too good looking.**I swear; it's a curse.
* **Sometimes I'll end[blog posts][2]with weird jokes about everyone I know dying**...and then totally fail to follow up.

More seriously though:

* **I'm good at abandoning things.**This might seem like a good thing, but it isn't always. I've lived in (and left) 5 major cities, and I'll have done the same with at least two more before another decade has passed. If something (or someone) starts to bore me, I find it very easy to just throw in the towel and move on. This is unlikely to happen with Jellybean Games - I've put a lot of time and money into it so far (logo, website, art for games) - or Blue Beard Entertainment generally. But it's certainly a possibility.
* **I'm not great at deadlines.**I'm pretty good at_keeping_deadlines - my issue is with_setting_deadlines. Part of this (especially for Jellybean Games) is that I simply don't know how long things take. Part of it is that I'm going to be working with a bunch of people I don't normally work with and sometimes my estimates for how long it'll take them to do things is way off. And part of it is that I, uh, forget to make a timeline and so things just sort of drift along until they suddenly become urgent (although I'm getting better at avoiding that).
* **Sometimes I'll get caught up in other creative commitments and disappear.**Again, this is something I've really been working on lately, but if my authorial income abruptly disappeared, I'd have to put everything else on the side while I worked on that. Sometimes I'll have some little idea that I get obsessed with (like[starting a podcast with my ex][3]) and suddenly that's all I'm working on for a week.
* **I don't have a home.**This is arguably a strength, but moving around a lot (in the first 3 months of 2016 I'm going to be in 8+ different countries, and none of them are going to be where I live for the next few years) can take up time and energy. On the plus side, I have no pesky "friends" or "family" to distract me while I'm on the road!
* **I'm new to this.**Everyone is new at some point, so I'm not beating myself up about it, but the fact is: I don't have a relationship with a printer, or a presence on Kickstarter, or any particular credentials or accolades behind me. I learn fast, and I am getting better at learning from other people's mistakes instead of repeating them myself, but there's a_lot_to learn. Still, no better way to learn than to jump in head-first!

To my mind, those strengths greatly outweigh the weaknesses. Add to that the pattern in my life of things going my way (you can call it luck, hard work, or just being a straight white male) and, all things considered, I think Jellybean Games has a pretty great chance of success. (And if it doesn't manage to achieve its goals, I'll learn a bunch for the next project!)
