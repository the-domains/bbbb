<p>When I first came up with Jellybean Games, it seemed pretty simple. Make good games that I was proud of, release them on Kickstarter. Repeat?</p><p>But then I started reading books about business, doing research, and - perhaps most importantly -<a href="http://bluebeard.silvrback.com/betterbrandingcourse.teachery.co">learning more about branding</a>and it quickly became apparent that wasn't enough.</p><p>Board games were booming, which is both good and bad. Good because - hey! More board games! Bad because it meant "showing up and doing a good job" wasn't going to cut it any more.</p><p>More and more tabletop games appear on Kickstarter every day, and it feels like every second person I meet has started a publishing company and is following the same path - the path that I was considering for myself.</p><p>Remember, it's not enough for me to do what everyone else is doing.<a href="http://www.beard.blue/the-blue-beard-business-story">I need to become significant in the field</a>.</p><p>So I sat down and started doing some brainstorming.</p><p>Originally Jellybean Games was just going to be "light games". That was the entire brand - games that are easy to pick up and play. My target market? Gamers, I guess.</p><p>But as I did the Better Branding course, and as I thought about it more and more, I realized that in order to have a chance at significant success, I needed to pinpoint my demographic.</p><p>In retrospect this might seem obvious (the best ideas always do) but it was only after about a week of brainstorming that I realized who the target audience for Jellybean Games was: parents.</p><p>All of my early game designs had a few defining characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>They were fast and light.</strong>This was for two reasons: I like light games, and light games (particularly when you're starting out) are the easiest to design. At least, they're the easiest to playtest, refine, and make enjoyable. If a game is meant to be fun within a few minutes of picking it up, it only takes a few minutes to know whether you've succeeded or failed. If a game is meant to be a satisfying 4-hour journey, it can take 4 hours to determine whether you've accomplished your goal...and when you're starting out, that's a bit daunting.</li><li><strong>They were modular.</strong>This is because I adore modular games, plain and simple. Even before I knew who Greater Than Games were, I was in love with the modular design of<em>Sentinels of the Multiverse</em>. Most of my favourite games (including<em>Codenames</em>,<em>Mysterium</em>,<em>Sentinel Tactics</em>,<em>Twilight Imperium</em>,<em>Galaxy Trucker</em>,<em>Roll for the Galaxy</em>and<em>Mage Knight</em>) have heavy modular elements - they just make me want to play the game over and over again, and know that it'll be a new (and interesting) challenge each time.</li><li><strong>They were card-based.</strong>This was partially because of my love of modular game-play, partially because they were far easier to prototype, and partially because I didn't know how to design a board. That sounds dumb, but to a certain extent I still don't - I can put one together, but whether it's in its best form or not is something I don't even know how to test. A modular board, however, is interesting to me, and for whatever reason I just<em>know</em>if it works or not, and how to adjust it if it doesn't.</li><li><strong>They were non-violent.</strong>I'm an extremely non-violent person. My old Melbourne gaming group is the same way, and we fell in love with stockmarket games. Stockmarket games are basically as cut-throat as you can get without actually becoming violent. My earliest game designs included: a space-based trading game (<em>Star Bazaar</em>), a game based around guessing who everyone is at a masquerade ball (<em>Dracula's Feast</em>) and a game about farming (<em>Harvest</em>).</li></ul><p>Being modular and card-based were mostly irrelevant, but non-violent, quick and light games? There's a name for those -<strong>family games</strong>.</p><p>My games were simple enough to be played by kids, but engaging enough that adults (who they were originally designed for, after all) to enjoy.</p><p>And thus, Jellybean Games' aim was clear: to make games that parents can play with their children (without either side getting frustrated), or play among themselves after the kids have gone to bed.</p><p>(I have friends with children, so I know how important a shorter game-length is for both of the above.)</p><p>So that's Jellybean Games' mission statement. After reading<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/create-a-tagline/">a few articles</a><a href="http://kopywritingkourse.com/how-to-create-a-great-tagline/">about writing taglines</a>, I condensed the idea into 6 words:</p><blockquote><p>Kid-friendly games (that grown-ups will love).</p></blockquote><p>If you've checked out<a href="http://www.jellybean-games.com/">the Jellybean Games website</a>, you'll notice that tagline is at the top of every page. I'm really proud of it - I think it tells visitors exactly the kind of games we're trying to make.</p><p>But as well as that, on the front page, there's another little mission statement:<strong>We want to make your new favorite game.</strong>That one isn't quite so targeted to parents, but I wanted to put it in there as well...because it is. I have no interest in releasing games that I don't personally love, and so yeah - ideally, every game I release will become<em>someone</em>'s favorite game.</p><p>Otherwise, what's the point of making them?</p><p>*Up next:<a href="http://www.beard.blue/the-blue-beard-business-story-part-4">Part 4 -*<strong><em>Goals, Strengths and Weaknesses</em></strong></a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Writing a Mission Statement</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

At least, they're the easiest to playtest, refine, and make enjoyable. If a game is meant to be fun within a few minutes of picking it up, it only takes a few minutes to know whether you've succeeded or failed. If a game is meant to be a satisfying 4-hour journey, it can take 4 hours to determine whether you've accomplished your goal...and when you're starting out, that's a bit daunting.</li><li><strong>They were modular.</strong>This is because I adore modular games, plain and simple. Even before I knew who Greater Than Games were, I was in love with the modular design of<em>Sentinels of the Multiverse</em>. Most of my favourite games (including<em>Codenames</em>,<em>Mysterium</em>,<em>Sentinel Tactics</em>,<em>Twilight Imperium</em>,<em>Galaxy Trucker</em>,<em>Roll for the Galaxy</em>and<em>Mage Knight</em>) have heavy modular elements - they just make me want to play the game over and over again, and know that it'll be a new (and interesting) challenge each time.</li><li><strong>They were card-based.</strong>This was partially because of my love of modular game-play, partially because they were far easier to prototype, and partially because I didn't know how to design a board. That sounds dumb, but to a certain extent I still don't - I can put one together, but whether it's in its best form or not is something I don't even know how to test. A modular board, however, is interesting to me, and for whatever reason I just<em>know</em>if it works or not, and how to adjust it if it doesn't.</li><li><strong>They were non-violent.</strong>I'm an extremely non-violent person. My old Melbourne gaming group is the same way, and we fell in love with stockmarket games. Stockmarket games are basically as cut-throat as you can get without actually becoming violent. My earliest game designs included: a space-based trading game (<em>Star Bazaar</em>), a game based around guessing who everyone is at a masquerade ball (<em>Dracula's Feast</em>) and a game about farming (<em>Harvest</em>).</li></ul>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"201136df-72bf-4496-a52b-3a931dae209a","item":"09d308de-7e73-4ece-af00-d91ad90125e5","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Being modular and card-based were mostly irrelevant, but non-violent, quick and light games?
